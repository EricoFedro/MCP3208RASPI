# MCP3208RASPI

MCP3208 is the IC chip that can covert analog signal to digital signal. It has DSP which helps to convert analog signal to digital signal in 12-bit channel. The below is the picture that i made for testing MCP3208 with RasberryPi. It communicates with RasberryPi through SPI communication. Once it is connected with RasbberyPi, RasberryPi shares its clock pulse and sends signal through MOSI and gets signal through MISO.
