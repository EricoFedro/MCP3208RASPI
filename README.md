# MCP3208RASPI

MCP3208 is the IC chip that can convert analog signals to digital signals. It has DSP which helps to convert analog signals to digital signals in a 12-bit channel. Below is the picture that I made for testing MCP3208 with RasberryPi. It communicates with RasberryPi through SPI communication. Once it is connected with RasbberyPi, RasberryPi shares its clock pulse and sends the signal through MOSI and gets a signal through MISO.
